## Core Features

1. **Chat UI Layout:** Implemented a chat interface with a clear layout for user messages and AI responses. The interface includes a chat history display area, a text input field for typing messages, and a send button to submit messages.

2. **Mock AI Responses:** Integrated functionality for the AI agent to respond with predetermined messages following each user input. These responses are displayed in the chat history alongside user messages.

3. **Responsiveness:** Ensured the chat interface is responsive, providing a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Optional Features Implemented

1. **Simulate AI "Thinking" Process:** Enhanced the chat interaction by introducing a brief delay to simulate the AI agent "thinking" before displaying its response. During this delay, send button will have waves, which simulates AI thinking.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Express.js (for chatbot backend)
